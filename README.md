### Assigment for my compiler class

- The objective is to create a Recursive Descent Parser using Java
- The vocab can be anything we decided on

### Plan

- My plan is to parse a valid assigment statement is a programming language
```java
type data = 10;
```

- The assingment statement has to include an identifier, the assignment '=' symbol and the value to
	assign, and ends with a semicolon
